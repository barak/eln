 UBUNTU FONT LICENCE Version 1.0
 -------------------------------
 .
 PREAMBLE
 This licence allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
 redistributed freely. The fonts, including any derivative works, can be
 bundled, embedded, and redistributed provided the terms of this licence
 are met. The fonts and derivatives, however, cannot be released under
 any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
 licence does not require any document created using the fonts or their
 derivatives to be published under this licence, as long as the primary
 purpose of the document is not to be a vehicle for the distribution of
 the fonts.
 .
 DEFINITIONS
 "Font Software" refers to the set of files released by the Copyright
 Holder(s) under this licence and clearly marked as such. This may
 include source files, build scripts and documentation.
 .
 "Original Version" refers to the collection of Font Software components
 as received under this licence.
 .
 "Modified Version" refers to any derivative made by adding to, deleting,
 or substituting -- in part or in whole -- any of the components of the
 Original Version, by changing formats or by porting the Font Software to
 a new environment.
 .
 "Copyright Holder(s)" refers to all individuals and companies who have a
 copyright ownership of the Font Software.
 .
 "Substantially Changed" refers to Modified Versions which can be easily
 identified as dissimilar to the Font Software by users of the Font
 Software comparing the Original Version with the Modified Version.
 .
 To "Propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
 computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
 distribution (with or without modification and with or without charging
 a redistribution fee), making available to the public, and in some
 countries other activities as well.
 .
 PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
 This licence does not grant any rights under trademark law and all such
 rights are reserved.
 .
 Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a
 copy of the Font Software, to propagate the Font Software, subject to
 the below conditions:
 .
 1) Each copy of the Font Software must contain the above copyright
 notice and this licence. These can be included either as stand-alone
 text files, human-readable headers or in the appropriate machine-
 readable metadata fields within text or binary files as long as those
 fields can be easily viewed by the user.
 .
 2) The font name complies with the following:
 (a) The Original Version must retain its name, unmodified.
 (b) Modified Versions which are Substantially Changed must be renamed to
 avoid use of the name of the Original Version or similar names entirely.
 (c) Modified Versions which are not Substantially Changed must be
 renamed to both (i) retain the name of the Original Version and (ii) add
 additional naming elements to distinguish the Modified Version from the
 Original Version. The name of such Modified Versions must be the name of
 the Original Version, with "derivative X" where X represents the name of
 the new work, appended to that name.
 .
 3) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) and any contributor to the
 Font Software shall not be used to promote, endorse or advertise any
 Modified Version, except (i) as required by this licence, (ii) to
 acknowledge the contribution(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or (iii) with
 their explicit written permission.
 .
 4) The Font Software, modified or unmodified, in part or in whole, must
 be distributed entirely under this licence, and must not be distributed
 under any other licence. The requirement for fonts to remain under this
 licence does not affect any document created using the Font Software,
 except any version of the Font Software extracted from a document
 created using the Font Software may only be distributed under this
 licence.
 .
 TERMINATION
 This licence becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
 not met.
 .

 INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL

 DEALINGS IN THE FONT SOFTWARE.
