Description: Electronic Lab Notebook called NotedELN
 NotedELN is an electronic lab notebook with an emphasis on solid data
 storage. It is designed for scientists of all stripes, and supports:
 .
  * Taking notes during experiments since it automatically saves your
    input every 10 seconds so that your notes will never be lost;
 .
  * Keeping track of data analysis results since screen shots and
    other graphics can be added to a notebook page by drag-and-drop or
    copy-and-paste;
 .
  * Recording your lit searches, since it will automatically download
    papers from PubMed and archive them with your notebook;
 .
  * Recording your thought processes, since it will never get in the
    way of your typing with arbitrary constraints on input formatting.
