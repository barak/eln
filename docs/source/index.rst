Introduction
============

NotedELN is an Electronic Lab Notebook for scientists of all
stripes. NotedELN is great for:

- Taking notes during experiments since it automatically saves your
  input every 10 seconds so that your notes will never be lost;

- Keeping track of data analysis results since screen shots and other
  graphics can be added to a notebook page by drag-and-drop or
  copy-and-paste;

- Recording your lit searches, since it will automatically download
  papers from PubMed and archive them with your notebook;

- Recording your thought processes, since it will never get in the way
  of your typing with arbitrary constraints on input formatting.

From its beginning in 2013, NotedELN has focused on reliability and on
the premise that a lab notebook should be a record for the ages. We
now have a track record of 10 years of daily use and not a single case
of data loss. In my experience, that is not easy to achieve even with
paper notebooks. Moreover, since most people type faster than they can
write by hand, NotedELN has helped us take more detailed and more
useful notes than we would otherwise have. When a student graduates,
they and their PI can each keep an original copy of all their notes.

NotedELN is free and open source and is available for Windows, Mac,
and Linux.

Development continues, and your suggestions, bug reports, and
contributions are welcome.
