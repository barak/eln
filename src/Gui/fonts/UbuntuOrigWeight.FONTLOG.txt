FONTLOG for the UbuntuOrigWeight fonts

This file provides detailed information on the UbuntuOrigWeight Font
Software.  This information should be distributed along with the
UbuntuOrigWeight fonts and any derivative works.

Basic Font Information

UbuntuOrigWeight is a Unicode typeface family that is an exact copy of
version 0.80 of a subset of the Ubuntu font family. The sole reason
why UbuntuOrigWeight exists is that in version 1.0 of the Ubuntu font
family the weights were dramatically changed. As such, documents
typeset in “Ubuntu Regular” in 2022 look very different when viewed in
2024. As this is unacceptable for lab notebooks, NotedELN now
incorporates a frozen version of the Ubuntu fonts.

The name “UbuntuOrigWeight” was chosen to respect clauses 2) (a) and
2) (c) of the Ubuntu Font License.

ChangeLog

10 February 2024 (Daniel Wagenaar) UbuntuOrigWeight version 0.80
- No changes from Ubuntu version 0.80

Acknowledgements

deserve any of the credit for these fonts, as they are identical
copies of the Ubuntu fonts.

The original Ubuntu Font License applies.
